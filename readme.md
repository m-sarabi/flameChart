# FlameChart

Visualize OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data as a responsive candlestick chart using SVG elements.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

2. ~~The chart fetches data from `data.json` and renders it inside the `chart` container.~~ The chart generates random data for now. Fetching from CSV, JSON, etc will be added.

3. Resize the browser window to see responsive behavior.
